### Edit Head Tag

Add the following code to your webpage's `head` tag.

```HTML
<!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@latest/surface_embed_v1.js"
  type="application/javascript"
></script>

<script>
  window.onload = function() {
		const surface_src = "<form url here>"
		const surface_embed_type = "inline"
		const target_element_class = "surface-form-target"
		const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

		c.embedSurfaceForm();
  }
</script>

<!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
```

Replace the `<form url here>` with the url to your surface form found by clicking the share button on the surface platform.

### Edit Div Tags

Surface needs to know where on the page you'd like to embed the form.

Add the class name `surface-form-target` to the div tags where you want the forms to be embedded. By default the form will take the entire height and width of the `div`.

```HTML
<div class="... surface-form-target"> </div>
```
