### Edit Head Tag

Add one of the following code snippets to your webpage's `head` tag, depending on how you'd like the form to appear.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Popup">
    ```HTML
    <!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

    <script
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@latest/surface_embed_v1.js"
        type="application/javascript"
    > </script>

    <script>
    window.onload = function() {
            const surface_src = "<form url here>"
            const surface_embed_type = "popup"
            const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
            const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

            c.embedSurfaceForm();
    }
    </script>

    <!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
    ```

  </Accordion>
{" "}

<Accordion title="Slideover">
    ```HTML
    <!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

    <script
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@latest/surface_embed_v1.js"
        type="application/javascript"
    > </script>

    <script>
    window.onload = function() {
            const surface_src = "<form url here>"
            const surface_embed_type = "slideover"
            const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
            const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

            c.embedSurfaceForm();
    }
    </script>

    <!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
    ```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Note the only difference between the two is the value of `surface_embed_type`

Replace the `<form url here>` with the url to your surface form found by clicking the share button on the surface platform.

### Choose trigger buttons

The next step is to choose which buttons you'd like to trigger the form.

This is done by simply adding the class name `surface-form-button` to the elements which should be able to make the form appear.

```HTML
<button class="... surface-form-button"> </button>
```

### Control Popup Size

In the case you are using the `popup` animation appearance, you can control the size of the popup that appears on your webpage. See the following snippet

```HTML
<!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

<script
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@latest/surface_embed_v1.js"
    type="application/javascript"
> </script>

<script>
window.onload = function() {
        const surface_src = "<form url here>"
        const surface_embed_type = "popup"
        const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
        const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

        c.popupSize = "medium" // This value can be "medium" or "large"
        c.embedSurfaceForm();
}
</script>

<!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
```

You can set the the `popupSize` variable on the `SurfaceEmbed` instance to control the size of the popup. Current accepted values are `medium` and `large`
