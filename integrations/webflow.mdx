### 1. Create a new form
Create a new form using our no code form builder here and copy the form sharing link. For this tutorial suppose its https://app.withsurface.com/s/cm1b711u80001l803477zv0n4
<Accordion title="Click to expand">
  <img className="block" src="/images/webflow/form.png" alt="Hero Light" />
</Accordion>

### 2. Navigate to the webflow designer screen and update the ID of the button that should open the form to `surface-form-button`
<Accordion title="Click to expand">
  <img className="block" src="/images/webflow/webflow-design.png" alt="Hero Light" />
</Accordion>

### 3. Now Let's add JavaScript
There are two different source URLs to choose from depending on how you would like your Surface Form to appear on your site

1. If you want your form to be a popup which appears in the center of the screen and appears/disappears with a fading animation, use the following script source url
```javascript
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@main/surface_embed_script.js
```
2. If you want your form to take up the entire screen and appear as a slide in, use the following script source url
```javascript
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@main/surface_embed_slide_fullscreen.js
```
After deciding which javascript source URL you'd like to use, Navigate to `https://webflow.com/dashboard/sites/<your_webflow_site_here>/code` and insert the following code in the `Head code` section.
```javascript
<script src="<SCRIPT_SOURCE>"type="application/javascript"></script> // replace <SCRIPT_SOURCE> with any cdn url from above. 

<script>
window.onload = function() {
  src='https://app.withsurface.com/s/cm1b711u80001l803477zv0n4'; // replace this with your surface form link
  buttonElementClass = 'surface-form-button'; // (optional) replace this value with your own button class
  embedSurfaceForm();
}
</script>
```
