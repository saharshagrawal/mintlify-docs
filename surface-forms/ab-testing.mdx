A/B testing in Surface Forms allows you to test multiple form variants to optimize conversion rates. Create experiments, track performance metrics, and make data-driven decisions to improve your forms.

## Creating an Experiment

<Steps>
  1. Navigate to the Experiments section
  2. Click "New A/B experiment"
  3. Enter experiment details:
     - Name your experiment
     - Add a description
     - Select form variants
     - Set test duration
  4. Configure traffic distribution
  5. Choose metrics to track
</Steps>

## Form Variants

Add and configure multiple versions of your form:

<Card>
  - Start with your default form variant
  - Add additional variants using "+ Add form variant"
  - Distribute traffic percentage across variants
  - Total distribution must equal 100%
</Card>

<Note>
  Each variant can have different designs, content, or flow logic while maintaining the same goal for accurate testing.
</Note>

## Traffic Distribution

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Default Variant" icon="square-1">
    Your original form design, typically starting with a higher traffic percentage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Variants" icon="square-plus">
    New versions you want to test against the default, with smaller initial traffic allocations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Performance Metrics

Track two key metrics to measure form performance:

### Conversion Rate
<Card title="Conversion Rate" icon="chart-line">
  Track the percentage of visitors who take the desired action to optimize your form's performance.
  
  - Measures form completion rate
  - Shows effectiveness of each variant
  - Helps identify best-performing designs
</Card>

### Email Collection
<Card title="No. of Emails Collected" icon="envelope">
  Measure the total emails captured to evaluate lead generation effectiveness.
  
  - Tracks total leads generated
  - Measures quantity of conversions
  - Helps assess lead generation impact
</Card>

## Experiment Duration

Set a specific timeframe for your test:

<Card>
  - Select start and end dates
  - Minimum recommended duration: 2 weeks
  - Consider your traffic volume when setting duration
  - Ensure statistical significance
</Card>

## Monitoring Results

Track your experiment performance:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Live Metrics" icon="gauge">
    - Conversion rates
    - Email collection numbers
    - Form visits
    - Distribution percentages
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Analysis Tools" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    - Performance comparisons
    - Statistical significance
    - Real-time data
    - Variant insights
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

<Card title="Testing Tips">
  - Test one major change at a time
  - Ensure sufficient traffic for statistical significance
  - Run tests for adequate duration
  - Document variant differences
  - Monitor results regularly
  - Make data-driven decisions
</Card>

## Common Test Elements

Consider testing these form elements:

- Form layout (Single vs Dual pane)
- Call-to-action text
- Form length
- Field order
- Marketing content
- Visual design
- Form step sequence
