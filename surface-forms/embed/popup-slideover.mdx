### Add Surface Tag

Before going ahead, make sure you import the `Surface Tag` first.<br/>
[Follow this guide to import the `Surface Tag`](/surface-tag/quick-start).

### Edit Head Tag

Add one of the following code snippets to your webpage's `head` tag, depending on how you'd like the form to appear.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Popup">
    ```HTML
    <!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

    <script>
    window.onload = function() {
            const surface_src = "<form url here>"
            const surface_embed_type = "popup"
            const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
            const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

            c.embedSurfaceForm();
    }
    </script>

    <!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
    ```

  </Accordion>
{" "}

<Accordion title="Slideover">
    ```HTML
    <!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

    <script>
    window.onload = function() {
            const surface_src = "<form url here>"
            const surface_embed_type = "slideover"
            const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
            const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

            c.embedSurfaceForm();
    }
    </script>

    <!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
    ```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Note the only difference between the two is the value of `surface_embed_type`

Replace the `<form url here>` with the url to your surface form found by clicking the share button on the surface platform.

### Choose trigger buttons

The next step is to choose which buttons you'd like to trigger the form.

This is done by simply adding the class name `surface-form-button` to the elements which should be able to make the form appear.

```HTML
<button class="... surface-form-button"> </button>
```

### Control Popup Size

In the case you are using the `popup` animation appearance, you can control the size of the popup that appears on your webpage. See the following snippet

```HTML
<!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

<script>
window.onload = function() {
        const surface_src = "<form url here>"
        const surface_embed_type = "popup"
        const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
        const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

        c.popupSize = "medium" // This value can be "medium" or "large"
        c.embedSurfaceForm();
}
</script>

<!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
```

You can set the the `popupSize` variable on the `SurfaceEmbed` instance to control the size of the popup. Current accepted values are `medium` and `large`

### Trigger Popup with external input

If you want to trigger the popup with an external input, follow the following steps:

1. Add the `surface-form-id` id to the `<form>` element.
2. Add the following scripts to your head tag:

```JSX
<script fetchpriority="high" 
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@latest/surface_embed_script_v4.js" 
        type="application/javascript">
</script>
<script type="module">
        window.onload=function(){let e=new URL(window.location.href),r="ENTER_YOUR_SURFACE_FORM_URL_HERE",n=`${r}?url=${encodeURIComponent(e)}`;src=n,formID="surface-form-id";var t=document.getElementById(formID);embedSurfaceForm(),t.addEventListener("submit",function(o){o.preventDefault();var m=t.elements[0].value;e.searchParams.append("email",m);var a=`${r}?url=${encodeURIComponent(e.toString())}`;document.getElementById("surface-iframe").src=a,showSurfaceForm()})};
</script> 

// replace ENTER_YOUR_SURFACE_FORM_URL_HERE with your surface form url

```
3. Done! Now you can trigger the popup with an external input.
