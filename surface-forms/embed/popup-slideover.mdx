### Add Surface Tag

Before going ahead, make sure you import the `Surface Tag` first.<br/>
[Follow this guide to import the `Surface Tag`](/surface-tag/quick-start).

### Edit Head Tag

Add one of the following code snippets to your site's `head` tag, depending on how you'd like the form to appear.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Popup">
    ```HTML
    <!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

    <script>
    window.onload = function() {
            const surface_src = "<form url here>"
            const surface_embed_type = "popup"
            const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
            const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

            c.embedSurfaceForm();
    }
    </script>

    <!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
    ```

  </Accordion>
{" "}

<Accordion title="Slideover">
    ```HTML
    <!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

    <script>
    window.onload = function() {
            const surface_src = "<form url here>"
            const surface_embed_type = "slideover"
            const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
            const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

            c.embedSurfaceForm();
    }
    </script>

    <!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
    ```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Note the only difference between the two is the value of `surface_embed_type`

Replace the `<form url here>` with the url to your surface form found by clicking the share button on the surface platform.

### Choose trigger buttons

The next step is to choose which buttons you'd like to trigger the form.

This is done by simply adding the class name `surface-form-button` to the elements which should be able to make the form appear.

```HTML
<button class="... surface-form-button"> </button>
```

### Control Popup Size

In the case you are using the `popup` animation appearance, you can control the size of the popup that appears on your site. See the following snippet

```HTML
<!-- Start of Surface Form snippet -->

<script>
window.onload = function() {
        const surface_src = "<form url here>"
        const surface_embed_type = "popup"
        const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
        const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

        c.popupSize = "medium" // This value can be "medium" or "large"
        c.embedSurfaceForm();
}
</script>

<!-- End of Surface Form snippet -->
```

You can set the the `popupSize` variable on the `SurfaceEmbed` instance to control the size of the popup. Current accepted values are `medium` and `large`

### Connect Surface Form to External Email Input

To enable triggering a Surface Form popup from a form field containing an email input, follow these instructions:

1. **Add the HTML Form**: Ensure your HTML form includes the `surface-form-handler` class. This class is essential for identifying the form as one that triggers the Surface Form popup. Example:

   ```html
   <form class="surface-form-handler">
     <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required />
     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

   > **Note:** Add the `surface-form-handler` class to any external form that you want to use to trigger the Surface Form popup.

2. **Include the JavaScript Code**: Add the following JavaScript to the page's `head` tag after the above scripts to handle form submission, validate the email field, and trigger the Surface Form popup. 

   > **Note:** You must replace the `<question_id>` within `params` below with the question ID from the Surface Form Builder.

        <Accordion title="Click to see where to find the question ID in the Surface Form Builder">
        <img className="block" src="/images/embed/question_id.png" alt="Screenshot showing where to retrieve the question ID in the Surface Form Builder" />
        </Accordion>

   ```html
   <script>
     window.onload = function () {
       const form = document.querySelector('form.surface-form-handler'); // Select the form by class name
       const params = {}; // Replace the key below with the question ID retrieved from the Surface Form Builder (e.g., replace "zYTngVeSzJFX" with your actual question ID)

       if (form) {
         form.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
           event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission

           const emailInput = form.querySelector('input[type="email"]');
           const emailValue = emailInput?.value.trim();

           // Custom email validation regex for stricter validation
           const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;

           // Check that email is valid and properly formatted
           if (emailInput && emailValue && emailRegex.test(emailValue)) {

             // IMPORTANT: Replace `<question_id>` with the question ID from the Surface Form Builder
             params["<question_id>_emailAddress"] = emailValue;

             c.showSurfaceForm(params); // Call your function with validated data
           } else {
             console.log("Invalid email address.");
             emailInput?.reportValidity(); // Show validation error for the email field
           }
         });

         // Ensure pressing "Enter" submits the form
         form.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {
           if (event.key === 'Enter') {
             const activeElement = document.activeElement;
             if (activeElement.tagName === 'INPUT' && activeElement.type === 'email') {
               event.preventDefault();
               form.dispatchEvent(new Event('submit', { cancelable: true }));
             }
           }
         });
       } else {
         console.error('Form with class "surface-form-handler" not found.');
       }
     };
   </script>
   ```

3. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - **Email Validation**: Ensures that the email field is not empty and matches a stricter email format.
   - **Triggering the Surface Form Popup**: When the form is submitted with a valid email, the `c.showSurfaceForm()` function is called with the email parameter.
   - **Keyboard Support**: The form handles the "Enter" key to ensure consistent behavior for submitting the form.

4. **Test Your Integration**:
   - Enter a valid email in the input field and press "Submit" or hit "Enter".
   - Verify that the Surface Form popup is displayed as expected.

Now you should be able to trigger a Surface Form popup from an external email input field!
